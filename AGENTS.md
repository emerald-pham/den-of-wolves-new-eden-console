# AGENTS.md

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) before repository work. It is the canonical
workflow and product-safety guide: use its risk-based task path, focused tests,
server-authority rules, emulator isolation, responsive UI checks, version and
changelog policy, and truthful merge/deploy closeout.

The roadmap facts live in the JSON catalog at
[`docs/implementation-prompts.json`](./docs/implementation-prompts.json), with
generated Markdown views for convenient reading. Update the catalog and
regenerate its views when a prompt, dependency, or status fact changes. The
optional dependency check (`npm run coordination:dependencies -- --prompt NNN`)
reports readiness and hard prerequisites, is read-only, and must not create
local nonce or goal receipts. `NEXT` is a ready-work hint, not a serial lock.
Regenerate the Markdown views with `node scripts/generate-prompt-views.mjs` after
catalog facts change; `--check` verifies generated output without editing.

Use a separate non-`main` branch/worktree, inspect `coordination:status` when
shared session/callable/rules, deploy/auth, release, or emulator resources may
overlap, and preserve other tasks' reservations. Coordination is optional and
does not require a universal implementation-prompt registration or commit
trailer. Keep accepted scope frozen except for directly blocking defects.
